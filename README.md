Alphavec is a lightning fast, minimalist, cost-aware vectorized backtest engine inspired by https://github.com/Robot-Wealth/rsims.

The backtest input is the natural output of a typical quant research process - a time series of portfolio weights. You simply provide a dataframe of weights and a dataframe of prices, along with some optional cost parameters and the backtest returns a streamlined performance report with insight into the key metrics of sharpe, volatility, CAGR, drawdown et al.

Thanks to the speed offered by vectorization, the observed portfolio performance metrics are automatically complemented with bootstrapped (n = 1000) estimations of upper and lower confidence limits. This gives a deeper insight into the potential future variance in outcomes for your strategy.

## Rationale

Alphavec is an antidote to the various bloated and complex backtest frameworks.

To validate ideas all you really need is...

```python

weights * returns.shift(-1)
```

The goal was to add just enough extra complexity to this basic formula to support sound development of cost-aware systematic trading strategies.

## Install

```
pip install git+https://github.com/breaded-xyz/alphavec@main
```

## Usage

See the notebook [alphavec.ipynb](alphavec.ipynb) for a walkthrough of designing and testing a rudimentary strategy using Alphavec.

```python

from functools import partial
import alphavec as av

prices = load_daily_crypto_close_prices()
weights = generate_strategy_weights()

results = av.backtest(
    weights,
    prices,
    freq_day=1,  # daily price periods
    trading_days_year=365,  # crypto is a 365 market
    shift_periods=1,  # close prices so we shift 1 period
    commission_func=partial(
        av.pct_commission, fee=0.001
    ),  # 0.1% fee on each traded amount
    spread_pct=0.0005,  # 0.05% spread on each streade
    ann_borrow_rate=0.05,  # 5% annual borrowing rate for leveraged positions
    ann_risk_free_rate=0,  # 0% risk free rate used to calculate Sharpe ratio
    bootstrap_n=1000,  # number of bootstrap iterations to calculate confidence intervals
)

```
